## Overview
Go repositories are supported by Artifactory since version 5.11.0.
To work with Go repositories you need to use [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory) and the Go client.

## Prerequisite
* Install version 1.11 or above of **go**.
* Make sure the **go** command is in your PATH.
* Install [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/)
* Make sure your Artifactory version is 5.11.0 or above
* Make sure your JFrog CLI version is 1.20.0 or above

## Running the Example
### Create Go Repositories in Artifactory
* Create a remote Go repository named *go-remote*.
* Create a local Go repository named *go-local*. 
* Create a virtual Go repository named *go*. 
* Include *go-remote* and *go-local* as part the *go* repository aggregated repositories.
* Set *go-local* as the Default Deployment Repository for the *go* repository.

### Build the Project Using JFrog CLI
CD to the root project directory

```console
Configure Artifactory:
> jfrog rt c

Build the project with go and resolve the project dependencies from Artifactory.
> jfrog rt go build go --build-name=my-build --build-number=1 

Publish the package we build to Artifactory.
> jfrog rt gp go v1.0.0 --build-name=my-build --build-number=1

Collect environment variabkes and add them to the build info.
> jfrog rt bce my-build 1

Publish the build info to Artifactory.
> jfrog rt bp my-build 1
```
